* BUG: devices that are SECURE or SHUTDOWN should have a delay of
* E2ELatency.timeout instead of auth_delay

* implement plotting scripts

* plot results:
  * 4 groups:
    * RandomTargeting/FixedRate
    * RandomTargeting/Multithreaded
    * Coordinated/Fixed
    * Coordinated/Multithreaded
  * Check if network size has impact:
    * # hosts in [100, 1000, 10000, 100000]
    * frac vulnerable in [0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75]
      * goal: hosts have no impact, but frac vulnerable does
  * Latency
    * compare ridiculously high latency vs ridiculously low latency
    * larger impact for multithreaded, but even then should be small
  * vary on-time and off-time
    * distribution
    * average in [600, 3600, 7200, 43200]
